    <string name="navigation_about_us_text">Did you know that only in Dhaka traffic wastes 5 million work hours which is equivalent to 37 thousand crores.
        So, we  4 developers aim to build an app to help people to find the most suitable parking space. We target two users. One, owner of the parking slots
        and another car owner or people who want to park their car. Want to save fuel and environment too. We notice that lack of parking space information,
        people park their car on road and get fined. So, we feel to build an app which will able to remove all kinds of difficulty related to car parking.Then we
        decide to build Parkit to fulfill our aim and serve people.</string>
